 *Simple Yet Effective C++ Libraries 

I’m happy to share a set of simple yet practical C++ libraries I’ve developed. These libraries are designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making them perfect for small to medium-sized projects. Here’s what they include:

clsDate: A straightforward library for handling dates and basic date operations.

clsInputValidate: A simple library for validating user inputs.

clsPeriod: A minimalistic library for managing time periods.

clsString: A basic library for text and string manipulation.

clsUtil: A utility library with general helper functions.
